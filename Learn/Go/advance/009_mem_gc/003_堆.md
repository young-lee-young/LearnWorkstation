### 堆

Go 每次申请的虚拟内存单元（heapArena）为 64MB，最多有 2^20 = 4194304 个内存单元，所有的内存单元组成了 mheap（Go 堆内存）

* heapArena 结构体（runtime/mheap.go/heapArena）

```go
package runtime

// 记录申请到的 64 MB 内存信息
type heapArena struct {
	bitmap       [heapArenaBitmapBytes]byte
	spans        [pagesPerArena]*mspan
	pageInUse    [pagesPerArena / 8]uint8
	pageMarks    [pagesPerArena / 8]uint8
	pageSpecials [pagesPerArena / 8]uint8
	checkmarks   *checkmarksMap
	zeroedBase   uintptr
}
```

* mheap 结构体（runtime/mheap.go/mheap）

```go
package runtime

type mheap struct {
	// lock must only be acquired on the system stack, otherwise a g
	// could self-deadlock if its stack grows with the lock held.
	lock      mutex
	pages     pageAlloc // page allocation data structure
	sweepgen  uint32    // sweep generation, see comment in mspan; written during STW
	sweepdone uint32    // all spans are swept
	sweepers  uint32    // number of active sweepone calls

	// allspans is a slice of all mspans ever created. Each mspan
	// appears exactly once.
	//
	// The memory for allspans is manually managed and can be
	// reallocated and move as the heap grows.
	//
	// In general, allspans is protected by mheap_.lock, which
	// prevents concurrent access as well as freeing the backing
	// store. Accesses during STW might not hold the lock, but
	// must ensure that allocation cannot happen around the
	// access (since that may free the backing store).
	allspans []*mspan // all spans out there

	_ uint32 // align uint64 fields on 32-bit for atomics

	// Proportional sweep
	//
	// These parameters represent a linear function from heap_live
	// to page sweep count. The proportional sweep system works to
	// stay in the black by keeping the current page sweep count
	// above this line at the current heap_live.
	//
	// The line has slope sweepPagesPerByte and passes through a
	// basis point at (sweepHeapLiveBasis, pagesSweptBasis). At
	// any given time, the system is at (memstats.heap_live,
	// pagesSwept) in this space.
	//
	// It's important that the line pass through a point we
	// control rather than simply starting at a (0,0) origin
	// because that lets us adjust sweep pacing at any time while
	// accounting for current progress. If we could only adjust
	// the slope, it would create a discontinuity in debt if any
	// progress has already been made.
	pagesInUse         uint64  // pages of spans in stats mSpanInUse; updated atomically
	pagesSwept         uint64  // pages swept this cycle; updated atomically
	pagesSweptBasis    uint64  // pagesSwept to use as the origin of the sweep ratio; updated atomically
	sweepHeapLiveBasis uint64  // value of heap_live to use as the origin of sweep ratio; written with lock, read without
	sweepPagesPerByte  float64 // proportional sweep ratio; written with lock, read without
	// TODO(austin): pagesInUse should be a uintptr, but the 386
	// compiler can't 8-byte align fields.

	// scavengeGoal is the amount of total retained heap memory (measured by
	// heapRetained) that the runtime will try to maintain by returning memory
	// to the OS.
	scavengeGoal uint64

	// Page reclaimer state

	// reclaimIndex is the page index in allArenas of next page to
	// reclaim. Specifically, it refers to page (i %
	// pagesPerArena) of arena allArenas[i / pagesPerArena].
	//
	// If this is >= 1<<63, the page reclaimer is done scanning
	// the page marks.
	//
	// This is accessed atomically.
	reclaimIndex uint64
	// reclaimCredit is spare credit for extra pages swept. Since
	// the page reclaimer works in large chunks, it may reclaim
	// more than requested. Any spare pages released go to this
	// credit pool.
	//
	// This is accessed atomically.
	reclaimCredit uintptr

	// arenas is the heap arena map. It points to the metadata for
	// the heap for every arena frame of the entire usable virtual
	// address space.
	//
	// Use arenaIndex to compute indexes into this array.
	//
	// For regions of the address space that are not backed by the
	// Go heap, the arena map contains nil.
	//
	// Modifications are protected by mheap_.lock. Reads can be
	// performed without locking; however, a given entry can
	// transition from nil to non-nil at any time when the lock
	// isn't held. (Entries never transitions back to nil.)
	//
	// In general, this is a two-level mapping consisting of an L1
	// map and possibly many L2 maps. This saves space when there
	// are a huge number of arena frames. However, on many
	// platforms (even 64-bit), arenaL1Bits is 0, making this
	// effectively a single-level map. In this case, arenas[0]
	// will never be nil.
	arenas [1 << arenaL1Bits]*[1 << arenaL2Bits]*heapArena

	// heapArenaAlloc is pre-reserved space for allocating heapArena
	// objects. This is only used on 32-bit, where we pre-reserve
	// this space to avoid interleaving it with the heap itself.
	heapArenaAlloc linearAlloc

	// arenaHints is a list of addresses at which to attempt to
	// add more heap arenas. This is initially populated with a
	// set of general hint addresses, and grown with the bounds of
	// actual heap arena ranges.
	arenaHints *arenaHint

	// arena is a pre-reserved space for allocating heap arenas
	// (the actual arenas). This is only used on 32-bit.
	arena linearAlloc

	// allArenas is the arenaIndex of every mapped arena. This can
	// be used to iterate through the address space.
	//
	// Access is protected by mheap_.lock. However, since this is
	// append-only and old backing arrays are never freed, it is
	// safe to acquire mheap_.lock, copy the slice header, and
	// then release mheap_.lock.
	allArenas []arenaIdx

	// sweepArenas is a snapshot of allArenas taken at the
	// beginning of the sweep cycle. This can be read safely by
	// simply blocking GC (by disabling preemption).
	sweepArenas []arenaIdx

	// markArenas is a snapshot of allArenas taken at the beginning
	// of the mark cycle. Because allArenas is append-only, neither
	// this slice nor its contents will change during the mark, so
	// it can be read safely.
